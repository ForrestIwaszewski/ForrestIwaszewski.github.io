        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Forrest Iwaszewski. I currently work at a Hospital as a PBX operator. My role within my current job is to simply take the calls that the hospital gets and transfer them over to the requested departments. Moreover, I also overhead page various codes throughout the hospital. I graduated from Helen Hunt Jackson High School and then moved on to graduate from Mt. San Jacinto Community College. Shortly after, I transferred over to University of California Riverside to pursue a masters in Political Science/Administrative Studies. After my time in UCR, I fully intend to transfer over to a law school so that I may prepare myself for the California State Bar Exam. Once I pass the Bar Exam, I intend to become a trial attorney. Politics and people are two of my passions and so by becoming a trial attorney I can use my political skills to defend people in a court of law. The job of a lawyer is to defend or prosecute people in the court of law using the given evidence within the legal process. I figured that this job is both very interesting and extremely rewarding. I find politics and case law to be extremely interesting and so the job of a lawyer definitely peaks my interest. Moreover, I enjoy working with people and as a lawyer it is essential to cooperate with others and so, this career path will allow me to be around others. Being a lawyer really does check all the boxes for me.<br><br>

        Some of my core values are honesty, accountability, and respect for the people around me. I believe it is important to show respect to people by treating others the way you would want them to treat you. I think I can extend this level of empathy in the field of law by defending people who have been wronged. I think it is important to help people who are in need because it is ultimately the right thing to do. As a lawyer, I will be in the position to best assist my community with any legal assistance that they may need.<br><br>

        So far I am getting closer and closer to achieving my goals as time goes on. I still have a long way to go and a lot more to learn but, I am always open to new challenges that improves my skills and widens my range of knowledge. I feel that my time in UCR will give me the challenges and experience that I need to improve my understanding of law. As my understanding increases, I can then share my knowledge with others who may have some of the same interests as I. Additionally, I hope to use this website as a way to extend my passion for law and people by informing online viewers of anything involving the world of law based on my own knowledge and research. Overall, this website will give me the opportunity to not only share my interests and knowledge with others but, it also serves as a way of keeping track of my own progress.
